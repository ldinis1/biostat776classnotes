# Citations ---------------------------------------------------------------

# In R, each package has info automatically generated on how to site it ïƒ  need citation function after creating the R markdown file.

citation("rmarkdown")
# this gives entry for references that you can copy and paste into citation manager

knitr::write_bib("rmarkdown", file = "my-refs.bib")
#will give you bibtext file that you can use directly

list.files()
#to see all files saved locally

#create bibtext entry and then

#Export bib file to desktop -> copy and past into bib file you are using and save it.
#Basically, keep a bibtext file with the references, which you can then do knitr and reference.

#In text reference
#[@key] for single citation
#[@key1; @key2] multiple citation can be separated by semi-colon
#[-@key] in order to suppress author name, and just display the year
#[see @key1 p 12; also this ref @key2] is also a valid syntax

#SciWheel -> collaborative reference manager
